# self-driving-car
Self driving car made using JS without using any libraries<br>
This project is done under the guidance of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI&t=5037s).<br> 


app.js -> includes the main drawing page of the application<br>
car.js -> featurs of car including its endpoints, borders, colour and more<br>
controls.js -> the movement controller of the car
road.js -> features of road which run for infinity<br>
utlis.js -> important utility functions like linear interpolation and segment intersection<br>
sensor.js -> the sensors of car used for detecting cars and borders<br>

on next commit -> addition of self driving ability using neural network
